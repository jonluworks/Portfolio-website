This is a portfolio website that I put together using Angular4.

## Main Features


### Everything is Custom

All the css styling, html, and javascript was written by me from scratch. I did not use any component frameworks, just
standard Angular4

### Responsive SPA

The page has a responsive layout that I implemented using custom breakpoints with media queries. All page updates occur
using asynchronous AJAX requests to a back-end server that I wrote from scratch using python/Django.

### Reactive Forms

I use Angular reactive forms to build my contact me page. This is the more advanced and robust forms package that Angular
provides. It is hooked into the mailgun API to automatically send me e-mails with the user's input.

### Reusable Components

I have several custom reusable components such as animated skill bars and information bars. The project is organized to 
follow Angular4 best practices and is fully modular.

### Custom Blog

The blog part of the website is written from scratch and supports searching by publication date, post title, custom tags, and more.
